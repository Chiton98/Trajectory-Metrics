# Trajectory metrics


This repository contains the code necessary to quantify and visualize
trajectory followed by the user on the serious game *Add link to a youtube video later*

To quantify the "quality" of user trajectory I used a metric based on
the smoothness, which uses the jerk called Normalized Jerk Smoothness(NJS) 
*Add link referencing the papers where that computation is showed*

To visualize the trajectory of the user a Python script was used.

## Project organization

The project has 3 folders

1. data: has the user trajectory information on .csv format. 
2. ComputationNJS: has the code to compute the NJS from the user trajectory using C#.
3. GraphTrajectories: has the code to visualize the user trajectory using Python.


## Run the program

Assumming we are on the root folder.
